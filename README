wmii-bazaar is my personal way for controlling the wmii windows manager.

== How To use it:

1) Copy software into a directory <path>
git clone git://github.com/angal/wmii-bazaar.git
          
2) Instruct wmii to use a different wmiirc
write into .xinitrc this line:

exec wmii -r <path>/wmii-bazaar/wmiirc-bazaar
